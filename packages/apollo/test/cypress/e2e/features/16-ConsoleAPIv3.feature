# Due to open bugs Console API cases are failing. Hence, moving it out from regression test suit.
Feature: Verify Console APIs are working as expected

	Background: Login to console
		Given I go to the console
		And I am logged in
		And I am ready to get started
	# 	And I am on the 'access' page

	Scenario: Testing API keys for manager, writer and reader

		Then As 'manager' run curl command with userId for "GET" request with URL "ak/api/v3/permissions/keys" completes with '200'
		# https://github.ibm.com/ibp/OpTools/issues/6111
