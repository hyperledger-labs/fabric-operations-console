	"ca_desc": "The underpinning of a blockchain network based on Fabric is identities and permissions. Identities take the form of x.509 certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) and can be compared to a credit card in that they identify someone within a particular context (credit cards identify an individual in terms of banking transactions, while Fabric identities allow users and components like peers to be identified in a blockchain context). This identity can include attributes, for example linking an actor to a particular organization. These certificates are then linked to the ability to perform actions on a network through their inclusion in an organization, which is defined by Membership Service Provider (MSP) folders containing certificates that exist at the component and channel level. For more information about identities, check out the tile about identities and the wallet.",
	"peer_desc": "At a physical level, a blockchain network is comprised primarily of peer nodes (or, simply, peers). Peers are the fundamental elements of the network because they host ledgers and smart contracts (which are contained in 'chaincode'). More accurately, the peer hosts **instances** of the ledger, and **instances** of smart contracts. Because smart contracts and ledgers are used to encapsulate the shared processes and shared information in a network, respectively, these aspects of a peer make them a good starting point to understand what a Fabric network actually does.",
	"peer_desc_2": "The Fabric Operations Console allows peers to be created, joined to channels, have smart contracts installed on them, made into anchor peers, and be seamlessly upgraded.",
	"orderer_desc": "Many distributed blockchains, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, are not permissioned, which means that any node can participate in the consensus process where transactions are ordered and bundled into blocks. Because of this fact, these systems rely on probabilistic consensus algorithms which eventually guarantee ledger consistency to a high degree of probability, but which are still vulnerable to divergent ledgers (also known as a ledger “fork”), where different participants in the network have a different view of the accepted order of transactions.",
	"orderer_desc_2": "The Fabric Operations Console works differently. It features a kind of a node called an ordering node that does this transaction ordering, which along with other nodes forms an ordering service. Because this design relies on deterministic consensus algorithms, any block a peer receives from the ordering service and validates is guaranteed to be final and correct. Ledgers cannot fork the way they do in many other distributed blockchains.",
	"orderer_desc_3": "The Fabric Operations Console uses an implementation of the Raft protocol, in which a leader node is dynamically elected among the ordering nodes in a channel (this collection of nodes is known as the “consenter set”), and that leader replicates messages to the follower nodes. Because the system can sustain the loss of nodes, including leader nodes, as long as there is a majority of ordering nodes (what’s known as a “quorum”) remaining, Raft is said to be “crash fault tolerant” (CFT). In the Console, users have the ability to select a single node ordering service or a five node ordering service, and then to add or remove nodes as needed. Ordering services can also be administered by several organizations.",
	"channel_desc": "A channel is a mechanism that provides a private layer of communication between members in the network. Multiple channels can be created between subsets of members, and because these channels are where asset transactions occur, they are sometimes called “application channels”. Data on the blockchain network is stored on a ledger, with each channel having its own separate ledger. These ledgers are hosted on the peers that have joined the channel. The Fabric Operations Console allows channels to be easily created and managed. Channel configuration updates allow the members of a channel to edit parameters as they see fit. For example, more members can be added to a channel, or the capabilities of a channel can be changed. Because changes to a channel must be approved by channel members, the Fabric Operations Console has a mechanism for the collection of necessary signatures.",
	"chaincode_desc": "From an application developer’s perspective, a smart contract, together with the ledger, form the heart of a Fabric Operations Console system. Whereas a ledger holds facts about the current and historical state of a set of business objects, a smart contract defines the executable logic that generates new facts that are added to the ledger. A chaincode is typically used by administrators to group-related smart contracts for deployment, but can also be used for low level system programming. Smart contracts are installed onto peers and instantiated to one or more channels.",

	"identity_desc": "The different actors in a blockchain network include peers, orderers, client applications, administrators and more. Each of these actors — active elements inside or outside a network able to consume services — has a digital identity encapsulated in an X.509 digital certificate. These identities really matter because they determine the exact permissions over resources and access to information that actors have in a blockchain network.",
	"identity_desc_2": "For an identity to be verifiable, it must come from a trusted authority. This is achieved with a Membership Service Authority (MSP), which defines an organization and the root CA associated with it. MSPs also define the rules that govern which identities in the organization are valid and the role of that identity in the organization. All identities can be found in a section of the console called the 'wallet', which can be located in the left navigation. ",
	"msp_desc": "On a conceptual level, a network on the Fabric Operations Console can be thought of as a collection of organizations that own and control various nodes and identities for the purpose of structuring and making transactions.",
	"msp_desc_2": "On a physical level, organizations are defined by a Membership Service Provider (MSP) which includes the root certificate of the CA issuing certificates for the entities associated with that organization, as well as the signing certificate of an admin of that organization. Organization definitions can be exported from one console into another. Organizations should be added to an ordering service, forming a consortium, the list of organizations allowed to create and join channels.",
